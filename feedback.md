Attempt at collecting feedback from the public announcement 27th of Dec 2013
=============================================================================


Overall big issues
==================
* copy & paste is a problem for many
* WinXP is locked out -> we know that. How about writing a subsection on the SNI default host trick?
* cipherString A,B,C option? Like Mozilla requested? With *big* disclaimer that the most compatibile one is the most insecure one.
* pull in sebix's pull requests
* short tutorial for non-git gurus on cherry picking

  * Mail Kurt Roeckx th of Jan: be consistent: 2048 RSA < 128 bit symmetric cipher strength. We should aim at 128+ bits symmetric strength. --> fix RSA 2048 in the document. Upgrade to 3072
