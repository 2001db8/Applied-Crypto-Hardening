\section{Disclaimer}
This guide can only describe what the authors currently \emph{believe} to be the best settings based on their personal experience. This guide was cross checked by multiple people. For a complete list, see the appendix section "reviewers". Even though, multiple specialists reviewed the guide, the authors can give \emph{no guarantee} whatsover that they made the right recommendations. After all, tomorrow there might be a new attack on some ciphers and much of the recommendations in this guide will turn out to be wrong.

Nevertheless, ignoring the problem and keeping outdated settings for SSL, SSH, PGP is not an option. We the authors, need this document as much as the gentle reader needs it.
