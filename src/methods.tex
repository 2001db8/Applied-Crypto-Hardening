For writing this guide, we chose to collect the most well researched facts
about cryptography settings and let as many trusted specialists as possible
review those settings.  The review process is completely open and done on a
public mailing list. The document is available (read-only) to the public
Internet on the web page and the source code of this document is on a public
git server, mirrored on GitHub.com and open for public scrutiny.  However,
write permissions to the document are only granted to vetted people.  The list
of reviewers can be found in the section ``\nameref{section:Reviewers}''.
Every write operation to the document is logged via the ``git'' version control
system and can thus be traced back to a specific author.  We accept ``git pull
requests'' on the github
mirror\footnote{\url{https://github.com/BetterCrypto/Applied-Crypto-Hardening}}
for this paper.



Public peer-review and multiple eyes checking of our guide is the best
strategy we can imagine at the present moment

We invite the gentle reader to participate in this public review process.
