\section{How this document was produced}

For many years, NIST was considered a reasonable choice for recommendations in
the field of cryptography. However, the NSA leaks of 2013 showed that even
certain NIST recommendations were
\cite{NSAEffortstoEvadeEncryptionTechnologyDamagedU.S.CryptographyStandard}{subverted
by the NSA}.  Therefore a new approach has been chosen for producing these
recommendations. 

We chose to collect the most well known facts about crypto-settings and let as
many trusted specialists as possible review these settings.  The review process
is done on a public mailing list. The document is offered (read-only) to a
publicly available git server. However, write permissions to the document are
only granted to trusted people, preferably outside of the U.S.  Every write
operation to the document is logged via the "git" version control system.  We
do not trust an unknown git server. The git server is hardened itself.
