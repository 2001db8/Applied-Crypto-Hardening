\section{Methods}

For many years, NIST\footnote{\url{http://www.nist.gov/}} was the most prominent
standardisation institute industry would consult for recommendations in the
field of cryptography. However, the NSA leaks of 2013 showed that even certain
NIST recommendations were
subverted\footnote{\url{http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=nsa-nist-encryption-scandal}}
by the NSA.  Hence, we can not blindly trust NIST's recommendations on cipher
and cipher suite settings. 

We chose to collect the most well known facts about crypto-settings and let as
many trusted specialists as possible review these settings.  The review process
is completely open and done on a public mailing list. The document is available
(read-only) to the public Internet on a git server. However, write permissions
to the document are only granted to trusted people. The list of editors is made public.
Every write operation to the document is logged via the ``git'' version
control system and thus can be traced back to a specific author.  We do not
trust an unknown git server. 

Public peer-review / ``multiple eyes'' checking our recommendation is the best
strategy we can imagine.
