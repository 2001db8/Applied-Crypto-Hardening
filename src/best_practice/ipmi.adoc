== IPMI, ILO and other lights out management solutions

Consider creating an unrouted management VLAN and access that only via VPN.

[IMPORTANT]
====
We _strongly_ recommend that any remote management system for servers such as ILO, iDRAC, IPMI based solutions and similar systems _never_ be connected to the public internet.
