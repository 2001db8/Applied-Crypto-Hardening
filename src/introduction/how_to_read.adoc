== How to Read this Guide

This guide tries to accommodate two needs: first of all, having a handy reference on how to configure the most common servicesâ€™ crypto settings and second of all, explain a bit of background on cryptography. This background is essential if the reader wants to choose his or her own cipher string settings.

System administrators who want to copy & paste recommendations quickly without spending a lot of time on background reading on cryptography or cryptanalysis can do so, by simply searching for the corresponding section in <<bestpractice>>.

It is important to know that in this guide the authors arrived at two recommendations: _Cipher string A_ and _Cipher string B_. While the former is a hardened recommendation the latter is a weaker one but provides wider compatibility. _Cipher strings A and B_ are described in <<recommendedciphers>>.

However, for the quick copy & paste approach it is important to know that this guide assumes users are happy with _Cipher string B_.

While <<bestpractice>> is intended to serve as a copy & paste reference, <<theory>> explains the reasoning behind _cipher string B_. In particular <<ciphersuites>> explains how to choose individual cipher strings. We advise the reader to actually read this section and challenge our reasoning in choosing _Cipher string B_ and to come up with a better or localized solution.
