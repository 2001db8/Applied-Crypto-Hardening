\section{Keylengths}
\label{section:keylengths}

Recommendations on keylengths need to be adapted regularly. Since this document
is static, we will rather refer to existing publications and websites.
Recommending the right key length is a hit-and-miss issue.

\url{http://www.keylength.com/} offers a good overview of approximations for
key size security based on recommendations by standardization bodies and
academic publications.

\begin{itemize}
\item For RSA cryptography we consider any key length below 2048 bits to be
deprectated at the time of this writing.  
\item For ECC we consider key length below
224 bits to be deprectated.  
\item For symmetric algorithms, consider anything below
128 bits to be deprecated.
\end{itemize}


One special remark is necessary for 3DES: here we want to note that it
theoretically has 168 bit security, however based on the NIST Special
Publication 800-57
\footnote{\url{http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html\#800-57-part1},
pages 63 and 64}, it is clear that 3DES is only considered 80 bits / 112 bits.
