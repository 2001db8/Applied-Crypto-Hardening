\section{Keylengths}

Recommendations on keylengths need to be adapted regularly. Since this document is static, we will rather refer to 
existing publications and websites.  Recommending the right key length is a hit-and-miss issue.

\url{http://www.keylength.com/} offers a good comparable overview of approximations for key size security based on recommendations by standardization bodies and academic publications.

In general, for asymmetric cryptography, any key length below 2048 bits is deprectated at the time of this writing.

%% NOTE XXXX FILL ME XXX 


%% proposal:

%% how about: >= 2048 bits for RSA
%% >= 256 bits for ECC?
