\section{Keylengths}

Recommendations on keylengths need to be adapted regularly. Since this document is static, we will rather refer to 
existing publications and websites.  Recommending the right key length is a hit-and-miss issue.

\url{http://www.keylength.com/} offers a good comparable overview of approximations for key size security based on recommendations by standardization bodies and academic publications.

In general, for asymmetric cryptography, any key length below 2048 bits is deprectated at the time of this writing.

%% NOTE XXXX FILL ME XXX 


%% proposal:

%% how about: >= 2048 bits for RSA
%% >= 256 bits for ECC? 

\subsection{Recommendations based on currently available information}

Configuration A:
strong ciphers, fewer users

MACs: Do not use SHA1. Why? XXX insert literature . BSI/ ENISA page XXX
Chaining mode: CTR, GCM, CCM (in this order).  XXX add reference to literature XXX
ciphers:     XXX add reference to literature XXX
Key Exchange: ECDHE\_RSA, DHE\_RSA, ECDHE\_ECDSA, (be careful about DH parameters . We want > 2048 bits) XXX FIXME: why? references to literature XXX


\subsubsection{Configuration B}
weaker ciphers, more users.


MACs: SHA1:  allowed
Chaining mode: GCM, CCM, CBC.
ciphers:    XXX add reference to literature XXX
Key Exchange: ECDHE\_RSA, DHE\_RSA, ECDHE\_ECDSA, (be careful about DH parameters . We want > 2048 bits)
