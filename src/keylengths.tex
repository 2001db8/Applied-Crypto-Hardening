\section{Keylengths}
\label{section:keylengths}

Recommendations on keylengths need to be adapted regularly. Since this document
is static, we rather want refer to existing publications and websites.
Recommending a safe key length is a hit-and-miss issue.

The website \url{http://www.keylength.com/} offers a good overview of approximations for
key lenght security based on recommendations by different standardization bodies and
academic publications.

\begin{itemize}
\item For traditional asymmetric public-key cryptography we consider any key length below 2048 bits to be
deprectated at the time of this writing.  
\item For elliptic curve cryptography we consider key lengths below 224 bits to be deprectated.  
\item For symmetric algorithms we consider anything below 128 bits to be deprecated.
\end{itemize}


One special remark is necessary for 3DES: here we want to note that 3DES
theoretically has 168 bit security, however based on the NIST Special
Publication 800-57
\footnote{\url{http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html\#800-57-part1},
pages 63 and 64}, it is clear that 3DES can only be considered to provide for 
80 bits / 112 bits security.
