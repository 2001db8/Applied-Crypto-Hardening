%%\subsection{Known insecure and weak cipher suites}
\todo{PG: please write this section. List all known broken, obsolete, weak and insecure cipher suites . Or even better: find the best site which keeps track of outdated cipher suites and simply reference it. We do not want to maintain such a list ourselves!}

%Ciphers with 112bit or less are considered weak and aren't recommended. Note that \texttt{3DES} provides only 112bit of security \footnote{\url{http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html\#800-57-part1}}.

% comment Florian:
% Please do not consider ciphers with a 112 bit key as weak. I think it is
% fine to do not recommend 3DES, but we should not claim that it is weak.
% In particular, 3DES with an effective keysize of 112 bits is still
% recommended by NIST and by ECRYPT2 for medium-term protection until 2030.


In general in this paper we do not recommend ciphers with less than 128 bit strength.

One special remark is necessary for 3DES: here we want to note
that it theoretically has 168 bit security, however based on the NIST Special
Publication 800-57
\footnote{\url{http://csrc.nist.gov/publications/PubsSPs.html\#800-57-part1},
pages 63 and 64}, it is clear that 3DES is only considered 80 bits / 112 bits.
