%%\subsection{Known insecure and weak cipher suites}
\todo{PG: please write this section. List all known broken, obsolete, weak and insecure cipher suites . Or even better: find the best site which keeps track of outdated cipher suites and simply reference it. We do not want to maintain such a list ourselves!}

Ciphers with 112bit or less are considered weak and aren't recommended. Note that
\texttt{3DES} provides only 112bit of security
