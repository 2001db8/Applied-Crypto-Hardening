%%\subsection{Architectural overview }

A cipher suite is a standardised collection of key exchange algorithms, encryption 
algorithms (ciphers) and Message authentication codes (MAC) that provides authenticated 
encryption schemes. It consists of the following components:

\begin{description}
\item{Key exchange protocol:}
``An (interactive) key exchange protocol is a method whereby parties who do not 
share any secret information can generate a shared, secret key by communicating 
over a public channel. The main property guaranteed here is that an 
eavesdropping adversary who sees all the messages sent over the communication 
line does not learn anything about the resulting secret key.'' {1} 
Katz, Lindell Introduction to Modern cryptography
Example: DH ECDH DHE ECDHE RSA

\item{Authentication:}
The client authenticates the server by its certificate. Optionally the server 
may authenticate the client certificate.
Example: RSA ECDSA DSA

\item{Cipher:}
The cipher is used to encrypt the message stream. It also contains the key size
and mode used by the suite.
Example: AES128 AES128\_GCM Camellia128

\item{Message authentication code (MAC):}
A MAC ensures that the message has not been tampered with (integrity).
Examples: SHA256 SHA384 SHA

\item{Authenticated encryption scheme:}
An encryption scheme which provides for confidentiality, integrity and authenticity.
