The PGP protocol
\footnote{url{http://tools.ietf.org/search/rfc4880}}
 uses asymmetric encryption to protect a sesion key which is used to encrypt a message. Additionally, it signs messages via asymmetric encryption and hash functions. %% what? - azet
Research on SHA-1 has showen that collision attacks are a real threat to the security of this hash function back in 2005\footnote{\url{https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2005/02/sha1\_broken.html}}, there are a PGP settings a user should change to avoid using SHA-1:

When using PGP, there are a couple of things to take care of:
\begin{itemize}
\item keylengths (see the section \ref{section:keylengths})
\item randomness (see the section \ref{section:RNGs})
\item the choice of RSA vs. DSA 
\item preferences for symmetric ciphers
\item preferences for hashing
\end{itemize}

Properly dealing with key material, passphrases and the web-of-trust is outside of the scope of this document. The GnuPG website\footnote{\url{http://www.gnupg.org/}} has a good tutorial on PGP.

\subsubsection{Keylengths}
We do not recommend any key length $\le$ 2048 bits. In fact, 4096 bits are probabaly a good choice at the time of this writing.

\subsubsection{RSA vs. DSA}
\todo{sure?}
RSA%%\footnote{}

\subsubsection{Symmetric ciphers}


\subsubsection{Hashing}
Tell GnuPG to not use SHA-1.
