\subsubsection{General server configuration recommendations}

For servers, we mostly recommend to apply what's proposed by the {\it Peter's manifesto}\footnote{https://github.com/stpeter/manifesto}.

In short:
\begin{itemize}
    \item require the use of TLS for both client-to-server and server-to-server connections
    \item prefer or require TLS cipher suites that enable forward secrecy
    \item deploy certificates issued by well-known and widely-deployed certification authorities (CAs)
\end{itemize}

The last point being out-of-scope for this section, we will only cover the first two points.

\paragraph{ejabberd}

\begin{description}
\item[Tested with Version:] Debian Wheezy 2.1.10-4+deb7u1

\item[Settings:] \mbox{}


ejabberd is one of the popular Jabber server.  In order to be compliant
with the manifesto, you should adapt your
configuration\footnote{\url{http://www.process-one.net/docs/ejabberd/guide_en.html}}:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
{listen,
 [
  {5222, ejabberd_c2s, [
                        {access, c2s},
                        {shaper, c2s_shaper},
                        {max_stanza_size, 65536},
                        starttls,
                        starttls_required, 
                        {certfile, "/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.pem"}
                       ]},
  {5269, ejabberd_s2s_in, [
                           {shaper, s2s_shaper},
                           {max_stanza_size, 131072}
                          ]},

  %%% Other input ports
]}.
{s2s_use_starttls, required_trusted}.
{s2s_certfile, "/etc/ejabberd/ejabberd.pem"}.
\end{lstlisting}

\item[Additional settings:]

Older Versions of ejabberd ($ < $ 2.0.0) need to be patched\footnote{\url{http://hyperstruct.net/2007/06/20/installing-the-startcom-ssl-certificate-in-ejabberd/}} to be able to parse all of the certificates in the CA chain.

Newer versions of ejabberd now support specifying the cipher string in the config file. See the commit message: \url{https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/commit/1dd94ac0d06822daa8c394ea2da20d91c8209124}. However, this change did not yet make it into the stable release at the time of this writing.

\subsubsection{Chat privacy - Off-the-Record Messaging (OTR)}

The OTR protocol works on top of the Jabber protocol(\footnote{\url{https://otr.cypherpunks.ca/Protocol-v3-4.0.0.html}}).  
It add to popular chat clients (Adium, Pidgin...) the following properties for chiffered chats:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Authentification
    \item Integrity
    \item Confidentiality
    \item Forward privacy
\end{itemize}

It bascially uses Diffie-Helleman, AES and SHA1. 

There are no specific configuration required but the protocol itself worth to be mentionned.

\subsubsection{IRC}

\todo{Quick draft -- to complete / review / validate}

There are numerous implementations of IRC servers.  In this section, we choose {\it Charybdis} which serve as basis for {\it ircd-seven}\footnote{https://dev.freenode.net/redmine/projects/ircd-seven}, developped and used by freenode. Freenode is actually the biggest IRC network\footnote{http://irc.netsplit.de/networks/top10.php}.  {\it Charybdis} is being part of the {\it Debian} \& {\it Ubuntu} distributions.
