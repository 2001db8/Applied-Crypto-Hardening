\section{A brief overview of common crypto software}

Broadly speaking, modern crypto software can placed into one of the two categories:

\begin{itemize}
\item assymetric cryptography 
\item symmetric cryptography
\end{itemize}

The most common crypto software implementations support both modes of cryptography. 

\subsection{Typical cryptography libraries, frameworks and tools}

\begin{itemize}
\item OpenSSL
\item GnuTLS
\item PGP
\item SSH
\item TrueCrypt
\item DM-Crypt
\item Bitlocker % XXX: needs to be discussed! bitlocker is probably backdoored (at least some research suggests it)
\item Apple FileVault 2
\end{itemize}
