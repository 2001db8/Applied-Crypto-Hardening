Cryptography (the word stems from the greek word "kryptos" (hidden, secret)) is an ancient art dealing with hiding messages. Amongst the oldest known cryptography examples are textst in the Kamasutra detailing how to encode love letters. If we jump forward to the computer age, we will find that the development of computers was always strongly intertwined with the developments of cryptoraphy and cryptanalysis (the art of breaking codes).  

The introduction of assymetric encryption in the 70s allowed us to  as a society to secure a significant part of our online communication. However, there are two problems with this:

1. most people don't use cryptography nevertheless. It is considered "hard" and [MerkelPhone]cumbersome.
2. getting the settings right is a non trivial task. 

This guide aims at helping *system administrators* to find the right settings for the most common cryptosystems. System administrators are in a unique position to "do something good" for many  people (their users).
