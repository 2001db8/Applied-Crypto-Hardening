== A note on Diffie Hellman Key Exchanges

A common question is which Diffie Hellman (DH) Parameters should be used
for Diffie Hellman key
exchangesfootnote:[http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/1963/how-large-should-a-diffie-hellman-p-be].
We follow the recommendations in ECRYPT II 

Where configurable, we recommend using the Diffie Hellman groups defined
for IKE, specifically groups 14-18 (2048–8192 bit MODP ). These groups
have been checked by many eyes and can be assumed to be secure.

For convenience, we provide these parameters as PEM files on our
webserverfootnote:[https://www.bettercrypto.org/static/dhparams/].
