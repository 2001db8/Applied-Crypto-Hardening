%\fixme{Secure Sockets Layer} is a network security protocol that aims to 
%provide confidentiality and authenticity of transmitted data. It is used 
%widely to protect higher level application protocols such as HTTP, SMTP, 
%IMAP, POP3, LDAP, etc.

%If SSL/TLS is correctly configured and used, it provides decent degree of security against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks. On the other hand, as illustrated by \fixme, there are several ways to defeat the protection.    

%The attacks can be either active or passive from network communications point of view. An 
%active attacker can modify the network communications and a passive attacker only.
