\item[Additional settings:]

You should redirect everything to httpS:// if possible. In Apache you can do this with the following setting inside of a VirtualHost environment:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  <VirtualHost *:80>
   #...

\subsubsection{MS IIS}
\label{sec:ms-iis}


\todo{screenshots? registry key settings? }

\begin{description}

\item[Tested with Version:] \todo{version?}

\item[Settings:] \mbox{}


When trying to avoid RC4 and CBC (BEAST-Attack) and requiring perfect
forward secrecy, Microsoft Internet Information Server (IIS) supports
ECDSA, but does not support RSA for key exchange (consider ECC suite
B doubts\footnote{\url{http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/rigid.html}}).

Since \verb|ECDHE_RSA_*| is not supported, a SSL certificate based on
elliptic curves needs to be used.

The configuration of cipher suites MS IIS will use can be configured in one
of the following ways:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Group Policy \footnote{\url{http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb870930(v=vs.85).aspx}}
\item Registry
\item IIS Crypto~\footnote{\url{https://www.nartac.com/Products/IISCrypto/}}
\end{enumerate}


Table~\ref{tab:MS_IIS_Client_Support} shows the process of turning on
one algorithm after another and the effect on the supported Clients
tested using https://www.ssllabs.com.

\verb|SSL 3.0|, \verb|SSL 2.0| and \verb|MD5| are turned off.
\verb|TLS 1.0| and \verb|TLS 2.0| are turned on.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{ll}
    \toprule
    Cipher Suite & Client \\
    \midrule
    \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256| & only IE 10,11, OpenSSL 1.0.1e \\
    \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256| & Chrome 30, Opera 17, Safari 6+ \\
    \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA| & FF 10-24, IE 8+, Safari 5, Java 7\\
    \bottomrule 
 \end{tabular}
  \caption{Client support}
  \label{tab:MS_IIS_Client_Support}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:MS_IIS_Client_Support} shows the algoriths from
strongest to weakest and why they need to be added in this order. For
example insiting on SHA-2 algorithms (only first two lines) would
eliminate all versions of Firefox, so the last line is needed to
support this browser, but should be placed at the bottom, so capable
browsers will choose the stronger SHA-2 algorithms.

\verb|TLS_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA| or equivalent should also be added if
MS Terminal Server Connection is used (make sure to use this only in a
trusted environment). This suite will not be used for SSL, since we do
not use a RSA Key.


% \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256| ... only supported by: IE 10,11, OpenSSL 1.0.1e
% \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA256| ... Chrome 30, Opera 17, Safari 6+
% \verb|TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA| ... Firefox 10-24, IE 8+, Safari 5, Java 7

\subsection{Mail Servers}

This section documents the most common mail (SMTP) and IMAPs/POPs servers. Another option to secure IMAPs/POPs servers is to place them behind an stunnel server. 

\subsubsection{Dovecot}


Dovecot 2.2:

% Example: http://dovecot.org/list/dovecot/2013-October/092999.html

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  ssl_cipher_list = 'EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+aRSA+SHA384:EECDH+aRSA+SHA256:EDH+CAMELLIA256:EECDH:EDH+aRSA:+SSLv3:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS:!RC4:!SEED:!AES128:!CAMELLIA128:!ECDSA:AES256-SHA'
  ssl_prefer_server_ciphers = yes
\end{lstlisting}

Dovecot 2.1: Almost as good as dovecot 2.2. Does not support ssl\_prefer\_server\_ciphers

\paragraph*{Limitations}\mbox{}\\

Dovecot currently does not support disabling TLS compression. Furthermore, DH parameters
greater than 1024bit aren't possible. The most recent version 2.2.7 of Dovecot implements
configurable DH parameter length
\footnote{\url{http://hg.dovecot.org/dovecot-2.2/rev/43ab5abeb8f0}}.

\subsubsection{cyrus-imapd (based on 2.4.17)}

\paragraph*{imapd.conf}\mbox{}\\

To activate SSL/TLS configure your certificate with
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_cert_file: .../cert.pem
  tls_key_file: .../cert.key
\end{lstlisting}

Do not forget to add necessary intermediate certificates to the .pem file.\\

Limiting the ciphers provided may force (especially older) clients to connect without encryption at all! Sticking to the defaults is recommended.\\

If you still want to force strong encryption use
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_cipher_list: <...recommended ciphersuite...>
\end{lstlisting}

cyrus-imapd loads hardcoded 1024 bit DH parameters using get\_rfc2409\_prime\_1024() by default. If you want to load your own DH parameters add them PEM encoded to the certificate file given in tls\_cert\_file. Do not forget to re-add them after updating your certificate.

\paragraph*{cyrus.conf}\mbox{}\\

To support POP3/IMAP on ports 110/143 with STARTTLS add
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  imap         cmd="imapd" listen="imap" prefork=3
  pop3         cmd="pop3d" listen="pop3" prefork=1
\end{lstlisting}
to the SERVICES section.\\

To support POP3S/IMAPS on ports 995/993 add
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  imaps        cmd="imapd -s" listen="imaps" prefork=3
  pop3s        cmd="pop3d -s" listen="pop3s" prefork=1
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Limitations}\mbox{}\\

cyrus-imapd currently (2.4.17, trunk) does not support elliptic curves. ECDHE will not work even if defined in your cipher list.\\

Currently there is no way to prefer server ciphers or to disable compression.\\

There is a working patch for all three features:
\url{https://bugzilla.cyrusimap.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3823}\\

There is no way to prevent unencrypted connections on the STARTTLS ports. You can prevent usage of plaintext login by setting
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  allowplaintext: 0
\end{lstlisting}
in imapd.conf. But note that SASL PLAIN/LOGIN is still available!\\




% XXX config von Adi?
% sslVersion = TLSv1
% ciphers = EDH+CAMELLIA256:EDH+aRSA:+SSLv3:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS:!RC4:!SEED:-AES128:!CAMELLIA128:!ECDSA:AES256-SHA:EDH+AES128;
% options = CIPHER_SERVER_PREFERENCE
% TIMEOUTclose = 1

\subsubsection{SMTP in general}

SMTP usually uses opportunistic TLS. This means that an MTA will accept TLS connections when asked for it during handshake but will not require it. One should always support incoming opportunistic TLS and always try TLS handshake outgoing.\\

Furthermore a mailserver can operate in three modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item As MSA (Mail Submission Agent) your mailserver receives mail from your clients MUAs (Mail User Agent).
\item As receiving MTA (Mail Transmission Agent, MX)
\item As sending MTA (SMTP client)
\end{itemize}
\mbox{}\\
We recommend the following basic setup for all modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item correctly setup MX, A and PTR RRs without using CNAMEs at all.
\item enable encryption (opportunistic TLS)
\item do not use self signed certificates
\end{itemize}

For SMTP client mode we additionally recommend:
\begin{itemize}
\item the hostname used as HELO must match the PTR RR
\item setup a client certificate (most server certificates are client certificates as well)
\item either the common name or at least an alternate subject name of your certificate must match the PTR RR
\item do not modify the cipher suite for client mode
\end{itemize}

For MSA operation we recommend:
\begin{itemize}
\item listen on submission port 587
\item enforce SMTP AUTH even for local networks
\item do not allow SMTP AUTH on unencrypted connections
\item optionally use the recommended cipher suites if (and only if) all your connecting MUAs support them
\end{itemize}



% Note that (with the exception of MSA mode), it might be better to allow any cipher suite -- since any encryption is better than no encryption when it comes to opportunistic TLS.

We strongly recommend to allow all cipher suites for anything but MSA
mode, because the alternative is plain text transmission.

\subsubsection{Postfix}

\todo{cm: document DANE}

First, you need to generate Diffie Hellman parameters (please first take a look at the section \ref{section:PRNG}):

\todo{FIXME: this is a really weak setting! See also: http://postfix.1071664.n5.nabble.com/postfix-hardening-what-can-we-do-td61874.html}
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  % openssl gendh -out /etc/postfix/dh_param_512.pem -2 512
  % openssl gendh -out /etc/postfix/dh_param_1024.pem -2 1024
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we specify these DH parameters in \verb|main.cf|:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  smtpd_tls_dh512_param_file = /etc/postfix/dh_param_512.pem
  smtpd_tls_dh1024_param_file = /etc/postfix/dh_param_1024.pem
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{MX and SMTP client configuration}\mbox{}\\

As discussed above, because of opportunistic encryption we do not
restrict the list of ciphers. There's still some steps needed to
enable TLS, all in \verb|main.cf| \footnote{Refer to
  \url{http://www.postfix.org/TLS_README.html} for an in-depth
  discussion.}:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  smtpd_tls_cert_file = /etc/postfix/server.pem
  smtpd_tls_key_file = /etc/postfix/server.key
  # use 0 for Postfix >= 2.9, and 1 for earlier versions
  smtpd_tls_loglevel = 0
  # enable opportunistic TLS support in the SMTP server and client
  smtpd_tls_security_level = may
  smtp_tls_security_level = may
  # if you have authentication enabled, only offer it after STARTTLS
  smtpd_tls_auth_only = yes
  tls_ssl_options=NO_COMPRESSION
  tls_random_source = dev:/dev/urandom		
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{MSA}\mbox{}\\

For the MSA \verb|smtpd| process, we first define the ciphers that are
acceptable for the ``mandatory'' security level, again in
\verb|main.cf|:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  smtpd_tls_mandatory_protocols = !SSLv2, !SSLv3
  smtpd_tls_mandatory_ciphers=high
  tls_high_cipherlist='EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM:EECDH+aRSA+SHA384:EECDH+aRSA+SHA256:EDH+CAMELLIA256:EECDH:EDH+aRSA:+SSLv3:!aNULL:!eNULL:!LOW:!3DES:!MD5:!EXP:!PSK:!SRP:!DSS:!RC4:!SEED:!AES128:!CAMELLIA128:!ECDSA:AES256-SHA'
\end{lstlisting}

Then, we configure the MSA smtpd in \verb|master.cf| with two
additional options that are only used for this instance of smtpd:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
587       inet  n       -       -       -       -       smtpd 
        -o smtpd_tls_security_level=encrypt -o tls_preempt_cipherlist = yes
\end{lstlisting}

For those users who want to use ECC key exchange, it is possible to specify this via:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  smtpd_tls_eecdh_grade = ultra
\end{lstlisting}

You can check the settings with the following command:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
$ zegrep "TLS connection established from.*with cipher" | /var/log/mail.log | awk '{printf("%s %s %s %s\n", $12, $13, $14, $15)}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
      1 SSLv3 with cipher DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
     23 TLSv1.2 with cipher DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
     60 TLSv1 with cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
    270 TLSv1.2 with cipher ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384
    335 TLSv1 with cipher DHE-RSA-AES256-SHA
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph*{Limitations}\mbox{}\\

tls\_ssl\_options is supported from Postfix 2.11 onwards. You can
leave the statement in the configuration for older versions, it will
be ignored.

tls\_preempt\_cipherlist is supported from Postfix 2.8 onwards. Again,
you can leave the statement in for older versions.

\subsubsection{Exim (based on 4.82)}

It is highly recommended to read

\url{http://exim.org/exim-html-current/doc/html/spec_html/ch-encrypted_smtp_connections_using_tlsssl.html}

first.

\paragraph*{MSA mode (submission)}\mbox{}\\

In the main config section of Exim add:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_certificate = ..../cert.pem
  tls_privatekey = ..../cert.key
\end{lstlisting}
don't forget to add intermediate certificates to the .pem file if needed.\\
\\
Tell Exim to advertise STARTTLS in the EHLO answer to everyone:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_advertise_hosts = *
\end{lstlisting}

If you want to support legacy SMTPS on port 465, and STARTTLS on smtp(25)/submission(587) ports set
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  daemon_smtp_ports = smtp : smtps : submission
  tls_on_connect_ports = 465
\end{lstlisting}
\mbox{}\\
It is highly recommended to limit SMTP AUTH to SSL connections only. To do so add
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  server_advertise_condition = ${if eq{$tls_cipher}{}{no}{yes}}
\end{lstlisting}
to every authenticator defined.\\

Add the following rules on top of your acl\_smtp\_mail:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  warn    hosts           = *
          control         = submission/sender_retain
\end{lstlisting}
This switches Exim to submission mode and allows addition of missing Message-ID: and Date: headers.\\

It is not advisable to restrict the default cipher list for MSA mode if you don't know all connecting MUAs. If you still want to define one please consult the Exim documentation or ask on the exim-users mailinglist.\\
% Exim maintainers do not recommend to change default ciphers
% I think we shouldn't, too
%use:
%\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
%  tls_require_ciphers = <...recommended ciphersuite...>
%\end{lstlisting}

The cipher used is written to the logfiles by default. You may want to add
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  log_selector = <....whatever your log_selector already contains...> \
   +tls_certificate_verified +tls_peerdn +tls_sni
\end{lstlisting}
to get even more TLS information logged.


\paragraph*{server mode (incoming)}\mbox{}\\

In the main config section of Exim add:

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_certificate = ..../cert.pem
  tls_privatekey = ..../cert.key
\end{lstlisting}
don't forget to add intermediate certificates to the .pem file if needed.\\
\\
Tell Exim to advertise STARTTLS in the EHLO answer to everyone:
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_advertise_hosts = *
\end{lstlisting}

Listen on smtp(25) port only
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  daemon_smtp_ports = smtp
\end{lstlisting}

It is not advisable to restrict the default cipher list for opportunistic encryption as used by SMTP. Do not use cipher lists recommended for HTTPS! If you still want to define one please consult the Exim documentation or ask on the exim-users mailinglist.\\
% Exim maintainers do not recommend to change default ciphers
% We shouldn't, too
%use:
%\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
%  tls_require_ciphers = <...recommended ciphersuite...>
%\end{lstlisting}

If you want to request and verify client certificates from sending hosts set
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_verify_certificates = /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
  tls_try_verify_hosts = *
\end{lstlisting}

tls\_try\_verify\_hosts only reports the result to your logfile. If you want to disconnect such clients you have to use
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_verify_hosts = *
\end{lstlisting}

The cipher used is written to the logfiles by default. You may want to add
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  log_selector = <....whatever your log_selector already contains...> \
   +tls_certificate_verified +tls_peerdn +tls_sni
\end{lstlisting}
to get even more TLS information logged.

\paragraph*{client mode (outgoing)}\mbox{}\\

Exim uses opportunistic encryption in the SMTP transport by default.

Client mode settings have to be done in the configuration section of the smtp transport (driver = smtp).

If you want to use a client certificate (most server certificates can be used as client certificate, too) set
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  tls_certificate   = .../cert.pem
  tls_privatekey    = .../cert.key
\end{lstlisting}
This is recommended for MTA-MTA traffic.\\

%If you want to limit used ciphers set
%\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
%  tls_require_ciphers = <...recommended ciphersuite...>
%\end{lstlisting}
% Exim Maintainers do not recommend ciphers. We shouldn't do so, too.
Do not limit ciphers without a very good reason. In the worst case you end up without encryption at all instead of some weak encryption. Please consult the Exim documentation if you really need to define ciphers.

\paragraph*{OpenSSL}\mbox{}\\
Exim already disables SSLv2 by default. We recommend to add
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
  openssl_options = +all +no_sslv2 +no_compression +cipher_server_preference
\end{lstlisting}
to the main configuration.\\
Note: +all is misleading here since OpenSSL only activates the most common workarounds. But that's how SSL\_OP\_ALL is defined.\\

You do not need to set dh\_parameters. Exim with OpenSSL by default uses parameter initialization with the "2048-bit MODP Group with 224-bit Prime Order Subgroup" defined in section 2.2 of RFC 5114 (ike23).
If you want to set your own DH parameters please read the TLS documentation of exim.\\



\paragraph*{GnuTLS}\mbox{}\\

GnuTLS is different in only some respects to OpenSSL:
\begin{itemize}
\item tls\_require\_ciphers needs a GnuTLS priority string instead of a cipher list. It is recommended to use the defaults by not defining this option. It highly depends on the version of GnuTLS used. Therefore it is not advisable to change the defaults.
\item There is no option like openssl\_options
\end{itemize}

\paragraph*{Exim string expansion}\mbox{}\\

Note that most of the options accept expansion strings. This way you can eg. set cipher lists or STARTTLS advertisment conditionally. Please follow the link to the official Exim documentation to get more information.

\paragraph*{Limitations}\mbox{}\\

Exim currently (4.82) does not support elliptic curves with OpenSSL. This means that ECDHE is not used even if defined in your cipher list.
There already is a working patch to provide support:\\
\url{http://bugs.exim.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1397}

\paragraph*{Assumptions}\mbox{}\\

We assume the usage of IKE (v1 or v2) for this document, and ESP.

\paragraph*{Authentication}\mbox{}\\

IPSEC authentication should optimally be performed via RSA signatures,
with a key size of 2048 bits or more. Configuring only the trusted CA
that issued the peer certificate provides for additional protection
against fake certificates.

If you need to use Pre-Shared Key authentication:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Choose a \textbf{random} PSK of 20 characters or more (\todo{length, references!})
\item Use a \textbf{separate} PSK for any IPSEC connection
\item Change the PSKs regularily

IPSEC Cryptographic Suites are pre-defined settings for all the
items of a configuration; they try to provide a balanced security
level and make setting up VPNs easier.

When using any of those suites, make sure to enable ``Perfect Forward
Secrecy`` for Phase 2, as this is not specified in the suites.

\verb|Suite-B-GCM-256| \footnote{\url{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6379}}
would be roughly equivalent to ``Configuration A``, but keep in mind
that it uses NIST elliptic curves for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

\verb|Suite-B-GCM-128| or
\verb|VPN-B| \footnote{\url{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4308}} would
be roughly equivalent to ``Configuration B``; again,
\verb|Suite-B-GCM-128| uses NIST elliptic curves, \verb|VPN-B| does
not.

\paragraph*{IKE or Phase 1}\mbox{}\\

IKE or Phase 1 is the mutual authentication and key exchange phase.

Use only ``main mode``, as ``aggressive mode`` has known security
vulnerabilities \footnote{\url{http://ikecrack.sourceforge.net/}}.

Encryption Algorithm: AES or CAMELLIA

Hash Algorithm: SHA2-256, SHA2-384 or SHA2-512

DH Group: Group 14--18 (2048--8192 bit DH), or 19-21 (256--521 bit
ECDH)

Lifetime: \todo{need recommendations; 1 day seems to be common practice}

\todo{what about CAST?}

\paragraph*{ESP or Phase 2}\mbox{}\\

Enable ``Perfect Forward Secrecy`` with a DH Group equivalent to the
one chosen for IKE.

Encryption Algorithm: AES-GCM-16, AES-CTR, AES-CCM-16, AES-CBC, SEED
or CAMELLIA \todo{order of this list?}

Hash Algorithm: none (if using AES-GCM), HMAC-SHA-SHA256 or longer
\todo{what about AES-XCBC-MAC?}

Lifetime: \todo{need recommendations; 1--8 hours seems to be common practice}


\subsubsection{OpenVPN}
\todo{cm: please write this subsubsection}
\todo{We suppose user uses easy-rsa which is roughly used in all HOWTO\footnote{http://openvpn.net/index.php/open-source/documentation/howto.html}}

\paragraph{Fine tuning at installation level}

When installing an OpenVPN server instance, you are probably using {\it easy-rsa} tools to generate the crypto stuff needed.
From the directory where you will run them, you can enhance you configuration by changing the following variables in {\it Vars}

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
export KEY_SIZE=2048 
\end{lstlisting}

This will enhance the security of the key exchange steps by using RSA keys with a length of 2048 bits.
\todo{Shouldn't we need to reduce CA and certificate lifetime?  Per default 10y!!}

\paragraph{Server Configuration}

In the server configuration file, you can select the algorithm that will be used for traffic encryption.
Based on previous recommendation established in that document, select AES with a 256 bits key in CBC mode.

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
cipher AES-256-CBC   # AES

# TLS Authentication
tls-auth ta.key
tls-cipher TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-CBC-SHA

auth SHA512
\end{lstlisting}

\todo{Explain a little bit tls-auth and auth directives + TEST}

The following ciphers are avaible and recommended\footnote{You can retrieve the list of supported algorithm on your OpenVPN installation thanks to the command {\it openvpn --show-ciphers}}
\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
AES-128-CBC
AES-192-CBC
AES-256-CBC
CAMELLIA-128-CBC
CAMELLIA-192-CBC
CAMELLIA-256-CBC
SEED-CBC
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Client Configuration}

Client and server have to use identical configuration otherwise they can't communicate.
The {\it cipher} directive has then to be identical in both server and client configuration.

\begin{lstlisting}[breaklines]
cipher AES-256-CBC   # AES
\end{lstlisting}
