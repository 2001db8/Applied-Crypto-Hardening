\epigraph{``Unfortunately, the computer security and cryptology communities have drivted apart over the last 25 years. Security people don't always understand the available crypto tools, and crypto people don't always understand the real-world problems.``}{-- Ross Anderson in \cite{anderson2008security}}

This guide arose out of the need for system administrators to have an
updated, solid, well researched and thought-through guide for configuring SSL,
PGP, SSH and other cryptographic tools in the post-Snowden age. Triggered by the NSA
leaks in the summer of 2013, many system administrators and IT security
officers saw the need to strengthen their encryption settings.
This guide is specifically written for these system administrators.

As Schneier noted\cite{Sch13},
it seems that intelligence agencies and adversaries on the Internet are not
breaking so much the mathematics of encryption per se, but rather use software
and hardware weaknesses, subvert standardization processes, plant backdoors,
rig random number generators and most of all exploit careless settings in
server configurations and encryption systems to listen in on private
communications.

This guide can only address one aspect of securing our information systems:
getting the crypto settings right to the best of the authors' current
knowledge. Other attacks, as the above mentioned, require different protection
schemes which are not covered in this guide. This guide is not an introduction
to cryptography on how to use PGP nor SSL. For background information on
cryptography, cryptoanalysis, PGP and SSL we would like to refer the reader to
the the references (see chapter \ref{section:Links} and
\ref{section:Suggested_Reading}) at the end of this document.

The focus of this guide is merely to give current best practices for
configuring complex cipher suites and related parameters in a \textbf{copy \&
paste-able manner}. The guide tries to stay as concise as is possible for such
a complex topic as cryptography. There are many excellent guides
(\cite{ii2011ecrypt},\cite{TR02102}) and best practice documents available when
it comes to cryptography. However none of them focuses specifically on what an
average system administrator needs for hardening his or her systems' crypto
settings.

This guide tries to fill this gap.
