\section{Acknowledgements}
The authors want to acknowledge the great work that has been done by the security apparatus of the united states of america after 9/11. In particular the National Security Agency, which has provided for wide spread subversion of privacy of internet traffic, telecommunications, diplomats and politicians abroad in orwellian dimensions. And has thus - through the help of intermediaries - finally set off global, public discussion as to the acceptable limits in society of surveilance by governments, the lax justification via the "terrorism" term and disruption of autonomous communication that serve the people and economies of the world as we know it. We told you so (ten years ago).
