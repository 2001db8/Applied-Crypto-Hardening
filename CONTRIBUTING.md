interested in discussing our document and changes is a valuable addition
to the project. Everybody is invited to work on this document and share
their experience and expertise with us or ask questions if something
isn't clear to them.

Here's a few things we'd like you to consider when contributing to this
project as some issues and discussions seem to creep up on us every now
and again or have already been discussed at length in the past. This
does not only make it easier for us to incorporate your changes,
feedback or critique - but might also save you some valuable time.

### General Information

* The [Applied Crypto Hardening mailing-list](https://lists.cert.at/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/ach) is the appropriate place for discussion

### Before you open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub

1. [Search open and closed
   issues](https://github.com/BetterCrypto/Applied-Crypto-hardening/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=) for duplicates or previous discussions
   related to the changes you propose.
2. Please take some time to read up on the [mailing list archives](https://lists.cert.at/pipermail/ach/) - over the years
   we've discussed quite a few topics in depth and you might just find
    the answer you were looking for or the reason we chose a certain
   configuration setting.
3. If in doubt, ask on the mailing list before you open large pull
   requests, refactor sections of the document or change security
   critical settings in recommended service configuration files.
