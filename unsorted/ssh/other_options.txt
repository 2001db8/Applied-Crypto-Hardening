PermitRootLogin shall be disabled (aka 'no') or at least reasonably restricted
('without-password', 'forced-commands-only').

Possible options:
ChrootDirectory jails the user into a separate environment

ForceCommand might help (especially with internal-sftp) to further limit possibilities of
a remote use. rssh might be used as a shell to achieve similar behaviour.
