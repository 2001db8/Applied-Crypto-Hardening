/etc/sshrc
~/.sshrc

Commands in this file are executed by ssh when the user logs in, just before the user's shell (or command) is started.

Happens after successful authentication and changing to user’s ~/:
If ~/.ssh/rc exists, runs it; else if /etc/ssh/sshrc exists, runs it;

Useful to monitor when suddenly user’s access SSH which probably shouldn’t be able to do so. (For example by sending email or a push message to administration staff.)
