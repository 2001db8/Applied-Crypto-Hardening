Debian/OpenSSH6 man page shows the following:
     Ciphers
             Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2.  Multiple ciphers must be
             comma-separated.  The supported ciphers are “3des-cbc”, “aes128-cbc”, “aes192-cbc”,
             “aes256-cbc”, “aes128-ctr”, “aes192-ctr”, “aes256-ctr”, “arcfour128”, “arcfour256”,
             “arcfour”, “blowfish-cbc”, and “cast128-cbc”.  The default is:

        Those Ciphers can be used:
                aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr
        Those Ciphers should not be used:
		aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,aes256-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,
                arcfour256,arcfour128,arcfour


     MACs    Specifies the available MAC (message authentication code) algorithms.  The MAC algo‐
             rithm is used in protocol version 2 for data integrity protection.  Multiple algo‐
             rithms must be comma-separated.  The default is:

        Those MACs can be used:
                   hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512,hmac-sha256-96
                   hmac-sha2-512-96,hmac-ripemd160
        Those MACs should not be used:
                   hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,
                   hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96,



Regarding compression: the default for compression is "delayed" which means, that compression
will only kick in after successful authentication (possibilities: yes, no, delayed).

TODO: does this put users at risk? shall compression be disabled alltogether?
