Debian/OpenSSH6 man page shows the following:
     Ciphers
             Specifies the ciphers allowed for protocol version 2.  Multiple ciphers must be
             comma-separated.  The supported ciphers are “3des-cbc”, “aes128-cbc”, “aes192-cbc”,
             “aes256-cbc”, “aes128-ctr”, “aes192-ctr”, “aes256-ctr”, “arcfour128”, “arcfour256”,
             “arcfour”, “blowfish-cbc”, and “cast128-cbc”.  The default is:

                aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,arcfour256,arcfour128,
                aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,blowfish-cbc,cast128-cbc,aes192-cbc,
                aes256-cbc,arcfour

TODO: which of those should be used?

     MACs    Specifies the available MAC (message authentication code) algorithms.  The MAC algo‐
             rithm is used in protocol version 2 for data integrity protection.  Multiple algo‐
             rithms must be comma-separated.  The default is:

                   hmac-md5,hmac-sha1,umac-64@openssh.com,
                   hmac-ripemd160,hmac-sha1-96,hmac-md5-96,
                   hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha256-96,hmac-sha2-512,
                   hmac-sha2-512-96

TODO: which of those should be used?

Regarding compression: the default for compression is "delayed" which means, that compression
will only kick in after successful authentication (possibilities: yes, no, delayed).

TODO: does this put users at risk? shall compression be disabled alltogether?
