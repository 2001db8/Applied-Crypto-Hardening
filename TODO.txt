Formatting
==========
DONE * one-column layout: make page margins smaller
DONE * add large "DRAFT" letters on top of every page.
  make the git version number part of the document
* Layout of sample code (lstisting format) : make it pretty!


Workflow
========

* how to keep things up to date?
* how to automatically test  compatibility?
* how to make sure that this document has the latest information on cipher strengths?

Contents
========
1. document the abstract needs that we have for the cipher settings (HSTS etc)
   Then find the best cipher setting strings per se
   Only then put it to all servers and keep it rather uniformely (as much as possible)

2. Test all settings 
* Test with more clients and other OSes than OSX / iPhone!!
* document (cite) EVERYTHING! Why we chose certain values. Referneces, references, references. Otherwise it does not count!
  Srsly!!
* .bib file is completely wrong. Make good citations/references. Add books: Schneier, ...
* !! important: add the version string to everything that we tested!!

* two target groups:
  - security specialists / freaks who want the very best settings
  - should as many clients work with the settings as possible
* look at TLS1.2 specs and really check if we want all of these settings
